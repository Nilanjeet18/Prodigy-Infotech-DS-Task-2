# Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship-Task-2:

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Data Cleaning And Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided Such as Titanic dataset from kaggale. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

# Tools and Libraries used
  1) Jupyter Notebook
  2) Pandas
  3) Numpy
  4) matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

  1) Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

  2) Visualization: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
