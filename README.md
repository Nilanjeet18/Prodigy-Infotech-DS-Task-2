# Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship-Task-2:

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Data Cleaning And Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided Such as Titanic dataset from kaggale. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

# Tools and Libraries used
  1) Jupyter Notebook
  2) Pandas
  3) Numpy
  4) matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

  1) Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

  2) Visualization: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
